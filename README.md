# flash-card-app

This is a program where you can learn the most frequently used word in any language. Its a flash card program, it shows you the front and back of the card.
For eg:

front:
French : aucun
back: 
English: no

After 3 seconds the card flips and you can check whether if you know the right answer.

If you got it right you can press the green tick, and if you got it wrong You can press the red cross.

If you press the green tick then it is going to take the flashcard out of all of the list of flashcards, so it does not show the things you already know, instead it only shows the things you dont know.

If you press the red tick then that flash card will go back into the deck and it might come up again at some point, so you can review it and learn it.
